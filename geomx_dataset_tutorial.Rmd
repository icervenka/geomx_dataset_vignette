# Loading libraries

Load required GeoMx and nanostring packages.

```{r libraries_geomx, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(NanoStringNCTools)
library(GeomxTools)
library(GeoMxWorkflows)
```

Load other useful packages.

```{r libraries_other, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(scales)
library(stringr)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

# Loading data

Set path to example data directory that comes with the package.

```{r set_datadir}
datadir <- system.file("extdata", "WTA_NGS_Example", package = "GeoMxWorkflows")
```

Locate dcc, pck and annotation files.

```{r data_location}
DCCFiles <- dir(file.path(datadir, "dccs"),
  pattern = ".dcc$",
  full.names = TRUE, recursive = TRUE
)

PKCFiles <- unzip(zipfile = dir(file.path(datadir, "pkcs"),
  pattern = ".zip$",
  full.names = TRUE, recursive = TRUE
))

SampleAnnotationFile <- dir(file.path(datadir, "annotation"),
  pattern = ".xlsx$",
  full.names = TRUE, recursive = TRUE
)
```

These variables only store file paths, not actual data.

```{r data_location_example}
SampleAnnotationFile
```

## Create Nanostring dataset

```{r create_geomx_dataset}
demoData <- readNanoStringGeoMxSet(
  dccFiles = DCCFiles,
  pkcFiles = PKCFiles,
  phenoDataFile = SampleAnnotationFile,
  phenoDataSheet = "Template",
  phenoDataDccColName = "Sample_ID",
  protocolDataColNames = c("aoi", "roi"),
  experimentDataColNames = c("panel")
)
```

## Important Notes
- `protocolDataColNames` has to correspond to the sample ID colname in the annotation Excel file
- `protocolDataColNames` have to be present in the annotation Excel file as well
- Annotation Excel file has to have colname call exactly 'slide name' (all lowercase with space) where information whether slide is a NTC has to be present. Otherwise the `readNanoStringGeoMxSet` will not recognize them.
- slide name column cannot be used as a variable in the plotting commands due to how the functions have been written. If a column that corressponds to these experimental variables is desired it has to be added manually with column name adhering to standard naming conventions (e.g. no spaces)

# Viewing and interrogating GeoMx data set
GeoMx dataset is based on older `ExpressionSet` objects originally developed to store microarray data, and have many similar functions as those described on [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/Biobase/inst/doc/ExpressionSetIntroduction.pdf)

## GeoMx dataset structure

![GeoMx dataset overview](images/geomx_dataset_overview.png)

Data within GeoMx dataset are internally stored in slots, accessed by operator `@`. You can find which slots are available by `slotNames` command
```{r geomx_slots}
slotNames(demoData)

demoData@protocolData
```
Slots will carry different information related to the dataset, such as probe metadata, sample metadata, QC information and actual measurments

- `dimLabels`
- `signatures`
- `design`
- `featureType`
- `analyte`
- `experimentData`
- `assayData`
- `phenoData`
- `featureData`
- `annotation`
- `protocolData`

## GeoMx dataset access

Several access functions are available for GeoMx dataset. Short intruction to R
indexing can be found [here](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-lang.html#Indexing)

Using [ selector directly on the NanoStringGeoMx object will select or subset the probes in case of rows and SampleIDs in case of columns on ALL relevant slots

```{r}
demoData[1:5, 1:10]
```

Returns name of files for individual sequenced areas (which also correspond to sample IDs)
```{r}
colnames(demoData)[1:5]
```

Returns the IDs of probes
```{r}
rownames(demoData)[1:5]
```

### Assay data

Contains matrices connected to measured reads for each sample and probe. It is stored in the GeoMx dataset as [environment](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/environments.html)

```{r}
assayData(demoData)
```

The easiest way to extract the contents of environment is to coerce it to list.
```{r}
names(as.list(assayData(demoData)))
```
Initially this environment will have a matrix of raw reads in a variable called `exprs`. Later, after data processing or normalization, additonal matrices with specific names will be added.
To access the `exprs` variable in assay data, one can use `exprs` function directly on GeoMx object.
```{r}
exprs(demoData)[1:3, 1:3] # accesses the data slot in the environment

# or equivalently
as.list(assayData(demoData))$exprs[1:3, 1:3]
```
GeoMx calls the variables/matrices in the `assayData` enviroment elements and you can additionally access them by `assayDataElement` function, where the second function argument is the element to return.
```{r}
assayDataElement(demoData, "exprs")[1:3, 1:3]
```

### Phenotypic data

Contains phenotypical info and metadata such as user designations of experimental groups, tissues or segments that samples belong to. Stored as [Annotated Data Frame](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/Biobase/versions/2.32.0/topics/AnnotatedDataFrame). 

```{r}
phenoData(demoData)
```
Contains both the actual data and metadata. Data is present in `@data` slot and metadata descriptions in `@varMetadata` slot.

```{r}
head(phenoData(demoData)@data)
```

Package also offers a shorthand function `pData` to directly extract the phenotypical data from GeoMx dataset and return is as regular data frame.

```{r}
head(pData(demoData))
```
You can use `[[` selector with metadata label to return only one column of phenotypical data.
```{r}
head(phenoData(demoData)[["slide name"]])
```
**NOTES:**

 - some of the variables are stored in `pData` as a list or nested data frame, so the name of the metadata labels might be different than the name of the columns returned
 - because of this, more columns can be returned as well

The same way the package offers shorthand function `varMetadata` to extract directly the dataframe with metadata and their descriptions
```{r}
head(varMetadata(demoData)) # is equivalent to head(phenoData(demoData)@varMetadata)

```

Or you can use `varLabels` function if you only want the metadata as a character vector:
```{r}
varLabels(demoData)
```


### Feature data

Annotated data frame with all feature variable values and variable meta-data. In this case features refer to the probes.
```{r}
head(featureData(demoData))
```

If you just want regular data frame with features and associated data you can use `fData` shorthand function.
```{r}
head(fData(demoData))
```

Or alternatively use `pData` function on the annotated data frame, which will also return the  `@data` slot
```{r}
head(pData(featureData(demoData))) # equivalent to the previous
```


Similar to phenotypic data, package offers `fvarMetadata` function to access feature metadata with descriptions. 
```{r}
fvarMetadata(demoData) # equivalent to varMetadata(featureData(demoData))
```

And analogously to only return available metadata as character vector one can use `fvarLabels`
```{r}
fvarLabels(demoData) # equivalent to varLabels(featureData(demoData))
```

### Protocol data

Annotated data frame with all protocol data and metadata. This will contain information related to experiment run such as software version, plate IDs or numbers of sequenced reads.
```{r}
head(protocolData(demoData))
```

Protocol data doesn't have its dedicated shorthand function to return only the `@data` slot, but `pData` function will work.
```{r}
head(pData(protocolData(demoData)))
```

Analogously to get metadata information one can use `varMetadata` and `varLabels` functions not on GeoMx object but on protocol data object.
```{r}
head(varMetadata(protocolData(demoData)))
```

```{r}
head(varLabels(protocolData(demoData)))
```

### Other

Function `sData` extracts the data frame containing the sample data corresponding to combination of phenoData and protocolData.
```{r}
head(sData(demoData))
```

and is equivalent to
```{r, include = FALSE}
head(cbind(pData(demoData), pData(protocolData(demoData))))
```

**NOTES:**

- will include unpacked QC flag data frame (or other nested dataframe) if it is present
